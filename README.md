# VR-Environment-Motorbike-Odyssey
An interactive virtual environment for motorbike enthusiasts.


The idea revolves around developing a motorbike showroom and dealershipâ€”the scene is set in the desert region near the sea, surrounded by palm trees. The showroom is located on the outskirts of a city a little further away from the water. The showroom targeted motorcycle enthusiasts and curious individuals trying to learn about biker culture.
